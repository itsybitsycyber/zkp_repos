    "If your application requires the creation and verification of custom circuits (e.g., for zk-SNARKs), you'll want a tool that supports circuit-based proofs. Libraries like bellman and arkworks are often used for this purpose. For simpler, non-circuit-based proofs, Bulletproofs and other aggregated proof systems might be suitable.
