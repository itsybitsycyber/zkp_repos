    "\n",
    "This questions aims to explore the creators of the ZKP applications to gain an understanding of who is building applications within ZKP space and with which tools. The diversity of developers and their projects within the realm of ZKP applications demands tailored tool recommendations based on the characteristics of the developer's team and the nature of the project. Understanding where you fall within these categories will guide you to the ZKP tools that align with your development team's composition and project goals. Each category has unique considerations, ensuring that your toolset is optimized for success in your ZKP journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "By identifying key metrics such as Author Count, Project Lifespan, Commit Count, and Activity among existing ZKP GitHub applications, three distinct groups of developers were identified. The metrics are defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "AuthorCount: The AuthorCount which is the total number of unique authors for a particular application. We defined an author as a GitHub user that has authored a commit to a repository. This is computed by looking at all the commits made to a repository and the contributors of the repository. Using the GitHub API, all the commits were fetched for each repository. Each commit has an Author and a Committer field. The Author is the person who made the changes to the codebase and the Committer is the person to committed to code to GitHub on behalf of the author. Generally the author and committer are the same person, but in some cases, they are not. If an author submits a pull request (PR) which is accepted and committed by the person reviewing the PR, the author and committer would not be the same. This tends to occur in collaborative repositories where contributions are made by submitting PRs. To account for all users that contribute code changes to a repository, we used the Author attribute of the commits for a repository to identify the unique number of authors. One final adjustment that had to be made was counting only GitHub users. This distinction was made to avoid counting the same authors more than once. This can happen when the Author field is not set up correctly, as in the case where an author does not have the same email address on their local git configuration and on their GitHub account or where commits were authored with an email address not linked to their GitHub profile. To ensure that only unique authors were accounted for, the Author fields in the commits were joined with the contributors for a repository. The list of contributors for a repository was retrieved using the GitHub API. In a Git repository, the contributors for a project identifies authors and committers by email address, and thus, their GitHub accounts. Matching the list of contributors with the list of unique authors found in the set of commits leaves the only the commits authored by unique GitHub users. This approach ensures that all unique GitHub accounts that authored commits are accounted for, the only limitation is that commits authored by non-GitHub users are not considered. In some cases, this resulted in applications having an AuthorCount of 0, since they had a single author that was not a GitHub user. This was the case for 12 applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lifespan: The Lifespan for a repository is the number of days between the first commit the the last commit. Initially Lifespan was created using the Created and Updated fields returned by the GitHub API for a repository, but those fields were not always consistent. \n",
    "\n",
    "CommitCount: The total number of commits made to a repository during its lifetime\n",
    "\n",
    "Active: The Active metric indicates where or not a repository has been committed to in 2023. \n",
    "\n",

    "When combining these attributes, three groups of 'Who' types were established. The Type 1 'Who' consists of an individual wanting to create a short-lived project as seen in the high number of single authors, short lifespan and inactivity of repositories. This could indicate that the creators are using the tools are part of a tutorial, research project or for experimenting with a tool. To explain the Type 2 'Who', it's best to first explain the Type 3 'Who', which is essentially a group of applications with outlying attributes. These tend to be large-scale popular applications with high AuthorCounts, high Lifespans, moderate to high CommitCounts and generally are Active. This, the Type 2 'Who' is the set of applications that are not single-owned, nor short-lived applications, nor industry-sized applications, instead these applications have moderate values for the metrics. These applications exist in the spectrum between the single-owned, short-loved applications and the large-scale industry applications. Type 2 applications tend to be smaller-scale projects compared to the group of outliers and have multiple authors committing to the project over an extended period of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the ZKP tool usage across the three Who types, all three groups had the arkworks set of arkworks\\algebra, arkworks\\std and arkworks\\curves as their most commonly used tools. However, when those were eliminated, the tool distributions different slightly among each group.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the Who types aims to classify the set of applications, however, there are applications that exist in every area of the spectrum, and thus there exists some overlap between the types due to the flexibility and ranges of the attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, the set of outliers were not the same for every attribute. protocols/loopring had an outlying value for the Lifespan attribute, but did not have outlying values for the AuthorCount or CommitCount values, but its values for the attributes were still in the high end of the normal range with AuthorCount = 39 and CommitCount = 3513. On the end, xjsnark/akosba had an outlying Lifespan value of 1655, but very low values for AuthorCount = 1 and CommitCount = 140. Its Lifespan excludes it from the Type 1 Who, and its AuthorCount and CommitCount exclude it from the Type 3 Who. A similar case with lattice-snarg/dwu4\thaving an outlying Lifespan value of 1646 but a low AuthorCount and CommitCount of 1 and 3. bitcoinprivate-legacy, mina and snarkos were the only applications that had outlying values for all the metrics. The reason Type 3 was expanded to include repositories that have some outlying values but not necessarily all, was to illustrate that applications with high values for these metrics tend to be large-scale industry projects, as seen in cairo/starkware-libs with a moderate Lifespan (517) and CommitCount (3998) but an outlying value for the AuthorCount (79).\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 2 contains open-source projects that have been contributed by multiple authors. There is great variance among repositories in this in type. For instance, the popular application (which is also a ZKP tool built using arkworks) is noir/noir-lang which falls into this category as it has high values for Age (1163), AuthorCount (38) and CommitCount(2744), yet none of these values are high enough for the application to be considered an outlier. In the same type, there are applications such as demo/zk-idm which is a much smaller-scale project with a low AuthorCount (2), moderate Lifespan(518) and low CommitCount (38). One could consider dividing this type into subtypes to differentiate between popular community projects and insignificant group projects, but defining further attribute ranges becomes a delicate task. \n",

    "\n",
    "This question pertains to the type of proof construction a developer intends to use in their project. The goal of this question is to guide developers toward selecting appropriate tools that support the specific proof construction method they plan to employ. Before looking at which tools support which proofs, it is useful to expand on the topic of proof constructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the two most prominent zero-knowledge proof systems are zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs. Both SNARKs and STARKs are used for validating proofs in an efficient and private way, but they differ in their implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "zk-SNARK stands for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge and was originally coined in a paper in 2012 (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2090236.2090263) co-authored by Nir Bitansky, Ran Canetti, Alessandro Chiesa, and Eran Tromer. At their core, SNARKs rely on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The 'Succinct' part refers to their small proof sizes and fast verification times that exist even for large statements. Succinctness ensures that the verification process does not take up as much time as the computation. This is achieved through the use of polynomial commitments (usually FRI, bulletproofs and Kate). The 'Non-Interactive' part indicates that the proof does not require constant interaction between the prover and the verifier. An important property of SNARKs is the need for a trusted setup ceremony. The trusted setup ceremony is a critical and delicate process that involves generating the initial parameters for the SNARK system. It is often referred to as the \"trusted setup\" because participants need to perform the setup honestly and then discard certain secret values. If the setup is compromised or participants act maliciously, it could undermine the security of the entire SNARK system. Hence, the need for a trusted setup is often regarded as a security concern of SNARKs. The first an most notable use of SNARKs was in the privacy cryptocurrency called ZCash. Since then, zk-SNARKs have been incorporated into L2 zk-Rollup solutions. Another downside to SNARKs is their lack of quantum resistance since quantum attacks do loom over cryptography based on elliptic curves(https://consensys.io/blog/zero-knowledge-proofs-starks-vs-snarks).\n",
    "\n",
    "zk-STARK stands for Zero Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge and is a specific type of SNARK. STARKs were discoverd in 2018 (https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf) in a paper published by Eli Ben-Sasson, Iddo Bentov, Yinon Horeshy and Michael Riabzev. Where SNARKs rely on ECC, STARKs rely on hash functions, which offers quantum resistance. STARKs have far larger proof sizes than SNARKs, which means that verifying STARKs results in greater verification overhead . This makes STARKs best suited for proofs with large witnesses, hence they are ideal when proofs need to scale. Unlike SNARKs, STARKs require no trusted setup because it uses publicly verifiable randomness to generate public parameters (https://hacken.io/discover/zk-snark-vs-zk-stark/). The development community of STARK-based projects is smaller than that of SNARKs, with the pioneering project being Starkware. \n",

    "Bulletproofs, introduced in a paper in 2017 (https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf), non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol with very\n",
    "short proofs and without a trusted setup. These properties are achieved through the used of a discrete logarithm problem, where Bulletproofs derive their security from the infeasibility from, and the Fiat-Shamir heuristic which makes the proof non-interactive (https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bulletproofs-in-crypto-an-introduction-to-a-non-interactive-zk-proof/). Bulletproofs can prove to a verifier that a secret lies within a given range, without revealing any information about the number.  Compared to SNARKs, Bulletproofs require no trusted setup. However, verifying a bulletproof is more time consuming than verifying a SNARK proof(https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/). They are smaller than STARKs, whilst maintaining significant efficiency and security (https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bulletproofs-in-crypto-an-introduction-to-a-non-interactive-zk-proof/). The most notable use of Bulletproofs is in the popular cryptocurrency, Monero. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of SNARK-based proving systems supported by tools in this paper: \n",
    "  - Plonk (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953) is a SNARK protocol which stands for \"Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge\" which  is a proof system designed to provide efficient, scalable, and versatile zero-knowledge proofs. Plonk was designed to address shortcoming of previous proving systems, such as the high proof construction overheads seen in Sonic(https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3339817). Plonk's improvement is that it's trusted setup is universal and updateable, meaning that only one trusted setup is required, instead of requiring a separate trusted setup for each program. Multiple parties can be involved in the trusted setup ceremony and requires only one honest party. Plonk is based on the cryptographic concept of polynomial commitments. \n",
    "  - Groth16 is a pairing-based SNARK protocol introduced by Jens Groth in his paper(https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) titled \"On the Size of Pairing-based Non-Interactive Arguments,\" in 2016. Groth16 is based on bilinear pairings, a mathematical concept commonly used in pairing-based cryptography. Bilinear pairings provide a way to efficiently compute certain mathematical operations over elliptic curve groups. One of the notable aspects of Groth16 is its size efficiency. The proof size generated by Groth16 is relatively small compared to earlier constructions, which makes it practical for use in real-world scenarios where proof size is a crucial consideration. For instance,  Plonk has a proof size of around 2x-5x that of Groth16 (https://medium.com/@mehialiabadi/plonk-vs-groth16-50254c157196).\n",
    "  - Pinocchio is one of the first SNARK protocols, introduced in a paper (https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/279.pdf) in 2013 by Bryan Parno, Jon Howell, Craig Gentry, and Mariana Raykova. Pinocchio is designed to provide succinct zero-knowledge proofs, meaning that the proof size is relatively short compared to the size of the computation being proven. This is an essential feature for practical applications, especially in scenarios where proof size is a critical factor\n",
    "  - Halo is a succinct zero-knowledge proof system introduced by Sean Bowe, Ariel Gabizon, and Ian Miers in a paper (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021.pdf) in 2019. Halo, as stated in the paper, is the first practical example of recursive proof composition without a trusted setup, using the discrete log assumption over normal cycles of elliptic curves. Halo is built as a variant of zk-SNARKs. Halo2, a tool featured in this paper, is built upon the Halo proving system. Halo2 is an improvement and evolution of the original Halo zero-knowledge proof system. It retains many of the features of Halo while introducing enhancements and optimizations. Where Halo is based on Sonic arithmetization, whereas Halo2 is based on Plonkish arithmetization.\n",

    "The merlin/dalek repository provides the implementation of a unique proof system, Merlin.

    "\n",
    "In the landscape of ZKP tools, there exists a spectrum of abstraction levels, each catering to distinct developer needs and project requirements. The inner workings of ZKPs involve an amalgamation of complex mathematical fields and concepts. Understanding ZKPs at a technical level requires a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics. Since there are tools at different levels of abstraction, determining which once to use may depend on the developer's level of understanding of ZKPs. The tool abstraction spectrum goes hand-in-hand with the ZKP understanding spectrum. Tools, such as those forming part of the `arkworks` suite, are used for more low-level development where fine-grained control over the ZKP system is required. On the other end of the abstraction spectrum are tools such as zkEVMs and zkVMs which typically come with built-in ZKP support, allowing developers to leverage these features without having to implement the underlying cryptographic primitives from scratch. This question aims to guide developers in choosing the level of abstraction that aligns with their level of understanding, familiarity and project goals, i.e. 'How 0 is Your Knowledge?'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before expanding on the levels of knowledge a developer my have, it is worth understanding what determines the complexity of a tool. To aid in understanding why certain tools are more suitable for different levels of understanding, each tool has been assigned a tool type. This is the classification or category that a specific tool falls into based on its primary functionality, purpose, or the way it is designed to be used. Each tool type represents a broad class of tools that share similar characteristics or serve a common goal within the field of ZKP development. The following tool types were devised:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low-level ZK Development:**\n",
    "Tools classified under this category are designed for developers who seek a high degree of control and customization in their ZKP implementations. They often involve direct manipulation of cryptographic primitives and require a deep understanding of ZKP concepts.\n",
    "These tools are best suited for experts or developers with a strong background in cryptography and a need for fine-grained control over ZKP constructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof System:**\n",
    "Proof systems provide a framework or set of protocols for constructing and verifying ZKPss. These systems define rules and structures for creating proofs and are foundational for building ZKP applications. They are useful for a range of developers who want to leverage specific and established proof systems for building ZKP applications without delving into low-level cryptographic details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Library:**\n",
    "ZKP libraries offer pre-built functions and utilities to simplify the implementation of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. They abstract away many cryptographic intricacies, making it easier for developers to integrate ZKP capabilities into their applications. Beginner to intermediate developers who want to use ZKPs without deep involvement in cryptographic details benefit from the various ZKP libraries. Usually, libraries provide a balance between abstraction and customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DSL (Domain-Specific Language):**\n",
    "DSLs are specialized programming languages tailored for expressing ZKP-related tasks. They provide a higher level of abstraction than general-purpose languages, making it easier to work with ZKPs for specific applications. DSLs are for developers who prefer a more expressive and focused language for ZKP-related tasks, offering a level of abstraction suitable for various application domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**zkEVM (Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine):**\n",
    "zkEVMs extend the concept of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to support Zero-Knowledge Proofs. They guarantee the correctness of programs, operations, and inputs and outputs, whilst maintaining EVM compatibility. Developers aiming to build privacy-centric decentralized applications (dApps) on blockchain platforms like Ethereum (or any other EVM compatible chains) where data confidentiality is a priority will benefit from using zkEVMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine):**\n",
    "A zkVM is a virtual machine that utilizes ZKPs to guarantees secure and verifiable trustworthiness by ZKPs. zkVMs are built with ZK-first principles, integrating them into every piece of the tech stack.[https://aleo.org/post/the-aleo-advantage-evolving-from-zkevms-to-the-zkvm-blockchain/] Unlike zkEVMs, zkVMs do not support EVM compatibility. zkVMs are suitable for developers interested in incorporating Zero-Knowledge features into broader computational models for privacy, security and scalability benefits. https://mirror.xyz/msfew.eth/Yl64OK3lLG48eJpVB3GxqFEhmWOm6yMlAo9sc1VrQP4\n",
    "\n",
    "By categorizing developers into three levels - beginner, intermediate, and expert — this question aims to guide developers toward ZKP tools that align with their current understanding and proficiency in this field. Here's a breakdown of each category:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Beginner:\n",
    "Description: Developers who are just starting their exploration of ZKPs fall into the beginner category and have limited or no practical experience with implementing ZKPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool Considerations: In this phase, developers may benefit from tools that offer a more user-friendly and approachable experience. Tools that abstract away complex details and provide extensive documentation and tutorials can be particularly helpful for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Beginner level tools consist of the zkEVMs, zkVMs and some high-level DSLs. The DSL, Leo, does not require a developer to have a detailed understanding of the inner workings of ZKPs as the low-level details are abstracted by the ecosystem. This level of abstraction is also seen in the tools zkSync which requires developers to write smart contract in Solidity (which most Web3 developers are familiar with already). Developers interact with RISC Zero by simply writing code and the service handles all the ZKP backend complexity. As explained in the Introduction to Miden VM, which is part of the ZKHack series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8xYSOx82U0), one of the main attractive points of zkEVMs such as the Polygon Miden, is the ease of use and no need to understand ZKPs and their cryptographic intricacies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Intermediate:\n",
    "Description: Developers with some experience and understanding of ZKPs but who are not yet experts fall into the intermediate category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool Considerations: Intermediate developers may be ready to explore tools that offer a balance between abstraction and control. These tools can provide more customization options while still offering guidance and documentation for continued learning. Using these tools are non-trivial as developers need to have cryptographic knowledge to understand the customization options of these tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most tools falling into the Library, DSL and Proof System categories fall into the Intermediate level of understanding required. These tools require a developer to have a thorough understanding of ZKPs while not requiring them to know the details of the foundational cryptographic elements. For instance, \n",
    "Plonky3 toolkit for implementing polynomial IOPs, such as PLONK and STARKs. It is built to support multiple types of cryptographic components, such instance various types of fields,  polynomial commitment schemes, polynomial IOPs, codes, interpolation and hashes. A developer would need to understand to understand each of these components and their different types in order to be able to customize the tool towards their needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Expert:\n",
    "Description: Seasoned developers with advanced knowledge in cryptography and significant experience in working with ZKPs fall into the expert category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool Considerations: Experts may prefer tools that provide maximum control and flexibility. They might be more comfortable with lower-level tools that allow fine-grained adjustments and customization to meet specific project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of arkworks tools fall into this category. Arkworks is Rust ecosystem for zkSNARK programming [https://github.com/arkworks-rs]. The ecosystem provides a collection of libraries specializing in low-level details such as algebra, curves, and cryptographic primitives. Arkworks provides a toolset which allows developers to customize their ZKP development stack without needing to create many cryptographic details from scratch. Arkworks forms the backbone of many zero-knowledge applications, even other ZKP tools, such as ZoKrates. Although aimed at being a toolkit for zkSNARK implementations, certain arkworks libraries have been used in the Cairo languages which is a DSL built around the zkSTARK construction. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is room for flexibility in these tool classifications as tools allow for a range of customization. For instance, refer to Circom. As a DSL, Circom allows developers to design, create and customize their own arithmetic circuits to be used in their ZKP projects. The modularity of the Circom language allows the definition of parameterizable small circuits, called templates, which can be instantiated to form part of larger circuits. This allows developers to create their own custom circuits with varied complexity [https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkevm/zkProver/circom-intro-brief/]. Developers who do not have the technical understanding to create their own circuits can use templates from CircomLib which is a library of basic circuits circom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration in understanding the various tool types and how they related to the level of understanding required came from a [blog post](https://www.blockchaincapital.com/blog/a-developers-guide-to-the-zkgalaxy) by Blockchain Capital's Ryan Sproule. \n",
